            Little Man Computer
        </h1>
        <p>
            A little man computer is a simplified model of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer" target="_blank">Neumann architecture computer</a> used to teach students about assembly how the machines 
            we're using all the time actually work. I was introduced to it as a part of my CS A-Levels, and after mucking around in <a href="https://peterhigginson.co.uk/lmc/" target="_blank">Peter Higginson's verison</a> I 
            decided to takea shot at making my own. 
        </p>

            The code in this project is "evil". I would not code in this way in a regular project, however, for this project I was aiming to really grasp how data is moved and managed by the CPU, therefore, the code rarely
            passes arguments to functions and instead there's an awful lot of moving data from registers. For example, to read the RAM, instead of calling a function that takes in the position in RAM and returns the value stored
            there, the MAR (Memory Address Register) is set to the address that I want to read, readRam() is called, and the data is sent to the MDE (Memory Address Register), the data is then sent to where it needs to go
            (usually the accumulator).
            <pre>
                <code>
def setMARtoOperand(self):
    print("Setting MAR to CIR operand")
    operand = self.CU.CIR % 100
    self.CU.MAR = operand

def readRam(self):
    print("Reading RAM")
    self.CU.MDR = self.RAM.getVal(self.CU.MAR)

def copyMDRtoACC(self):
    print("Copying contents of MDR to Accumulator")
    self.ALU.ACC = self.CU.MDR
                </code>
            </pre>

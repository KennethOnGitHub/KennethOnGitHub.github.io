It’s goal is to make you laugh, and little beyond that. Indeed I laughed for most of the movie. It is hard for me to find much fault when I am laughing that much.

And I kind of enjoyed the story, it was a little odd and funny.",v,o,T="It is unusual among animated movies in that its focus is jokes, kind of like a stand-up act.
